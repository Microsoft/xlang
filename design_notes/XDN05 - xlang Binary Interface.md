# Title: XDN05 - xlang Binary Interface

- Author: Harry Pierson (hpierson@microsoft.com)
- Status: draft

## Abstract

This design note describes xlang's [application binary interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
(or ABI). The ABI defines a stable contract between xlang language projections and xlang components
that is necessary in order to interoperate.
