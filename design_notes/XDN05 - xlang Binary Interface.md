# Title: XDN05 - xlang Binary Interface

- Author: Harry Pierson (hpierson@microsoft.com)
- Status: draft

## Abstract

This design note describes xlang's
[application binary interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
(or ABI). The ABI defines a stable contract between xlang language projections and xlang components
that is necessary in order to interoperate.

## Overview

xlang components are intended to be authored and built independently from their clients - both
applications as well as other xlang components. Because an xlang component may be built at a
different time and potentially using a different compiler from the calling code, xlang needs a
stable contract - known as an application binary interface or ABI - to enable interoperability.

xlang uses COM interfaces as the stable contract for xlang object types. Flat C functions are also
used in xlang component binary loading as well as in xlang's
[Platform Abstraction Layer](XDN06%20-%20xlang%20Platform%20Abstraction%20Layer.md).

## COM Interfaces

> This section is intended to be a short introduction to COM interfaces. For a more thorough
definition of COM interfaces, please review the official Microsoft
[COM Technical Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/com-technical-overview).

[COM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/component-object-model--com--portal)
is a Microsoft technology that defines a binary interoperability standard for creating reusable
software libraries that interact at run time. xlang leverages
[COM interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/com-objects-and-interfaces)
as well as the definition of fundamental COM interface
[IUnknown](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/using-and-implementing-iunknown)
as a foundation for stable contracts that both components and language projections can depend on.

A COM interface pointer is basically a pointer to an array of function pointers, similar to how most
C++ compilers implement
[virtual method tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table).
Each member of a COM interface is stored in an array slot as a function pointer. Each function in
the array takes the array pointer as its first parameter. While this design is intrinsic to most
C++ compilers, these function pointer arrays can also be built up explicitly in other languages
where needed.

COM interfaces are identified by a 128-bit integer known as a globally unique identifier or
[GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).
This identifier enables calling code to query a given xlang component about its support for specific
interfaces.

Once a COM interface is published, it cannot be changed. As stated before, a COM interface is a
stable contract between caller and callee. Interoperability would be impossible if COM interfaces
were allowed to change over time.

COM Interfaces are allowed to inherit from other interfaces. This is often used to add capabilities
to later versions of a given component. By inheriting from another interface, the COM interface is
defining a single longer array of function pointers, where the first set of function pointers are
defined by the base interface while the next set of function pointers are defined by the derived
interface. Multiple levels of COM interface single inheritance is supported.

> Note, while xlang uses COM interfaces as a stable contract between components, xlang is explicitly
avoiding the rest of the COM standard, including concepts such as apartments, monikers and
marshalling. These constructs are tightly bound to the Windows platform and so have little use in
the xlang project. Likewise, xlang is explicitly avoiding Windows technologies that build on COM
such as DCOM, MTS, COM+ and ActiveX. Windows Runtime is the core inspiration for xlang and is
expected to interoperate with xlang on Windows. However, ABI compatibility with WinRT is explicitly
_not_ a goal for the xlang project.

## IUnknown

> This section is intended to be a short introduction to the IUnknown COM interface. For a more
thorough explanation of IUnknown, please review the official Microsoft documentation
[Using and Implementing IUnknown](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/using-and-implementing-iunknown).

IUnknown is the root COM interface in any COM-based system. It provides functions for two core
capabilities - navigating an object's capabilities and managing the object's lifetime. All COM
interfaces derive from IUnknown and all objects in any COM based system must implement these methods.

``` cpp
// IUnknown GUID identifier: 00000000-0000-0000-C000-000000000046
struct IUnknown
{
    int32_t  QueryInterface(guid const& id, void** object);
    uint32_t AddRef();
    uint32_t Release();
};
```

### QueryInterface

Given any COM interface pointer, you can query for any other COM interface via IUnknown's
QueryInterface method. If the referenced COM object supports the interface being queried, a pointer
to that COM interface is returned to the caller. Otherwise, an error code indicating that the
requested interface is not supported.

As stated above, interfaces are identified by a GUID. This GUID is passed by reference as the first
parameter of QueryInterface. The pointer to the requested interface - if available - is returned via
a void** out parameter. It is the responsibility of the calling code to cast this pointer to the
correct COM interface pointer type.

Methods on COM interfaces (including xlang ABI interfaces) never throw C++ exceptions, due to the
need for a stable contract across compilers. QueryInterface returns a 32-bit signed integer as an
error code. On Windows, this code is known as an
[HRESULT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/com/error-handling-in-com).
Negative HRESULT values indicate errors while non-negative HRESULT values (including zero) indicate
success. QueryInterface in particular should always return 0 on success.

If the requested interface is not supported by the object, QueryInterface returns the error code
value 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE).

### AddRef and Release

COM objects manage their own lifetime via an internal reference count. When this count goes to zero,
the COM object cleans itself up. IUnknown provides methods to increment and decrement the object's
reference count. If a language projection makes a copy of a COM interface pointer, it must call
AddRef. When client code is finished using a given pointer to a COM interface, the language
projection must call Release.

The return value of these function is specified to be the new reference count of the object. However
the COM standard itself warns that this value is intended to be used only for test purposes. In
practice on Windows, the value returned from these two functions is not guaranteed to be the object's
true reference count. For example, COM object can choose to implement an "tear-off" interfaces.
A tear-off interface is implemented on a separate object, which is constructed when the interface
in question is queried. When AddRef or Release is called on the tear-off interface, it will return
the reference count of the tear off interface object *not* the reference count of the original
object.

## IXlangObject

In addition to the core functionality described by IUnknown, ABI interfaces for projected xlang
types derive from IXlangObject. This interface adds additional core functionality needed for xlang.

``` cpp
enum XlangObjectInfoCategory
{
    TypeName,
    StringRepresentation,
    ObjectSize
};

// IXlangObject GUID identifier to be determined
struct IXlangObject
{
    bool GetObjectInfo(XlangObjectInfoCategory info_category, void** info);
};
```

### GetObjectInfo

In WinRT, the IInspectable interface provides property get methods that retrieve information about
the object needed in specific runtime scenarios. Over time, the list of information categories that
might be useful at runtime has grown. For example, knowing the memory footprint of a given WinRT
object would allow for garbage collected languages like C# to make better scheduling decisions. But
since IInspectable is the base COM interface for every interface in WinRT, it's impossible to extend.

For xlang, instead of individual property get methods, IXlangObject exposes a single GetObjectInfo
method. The method takes an enum value indicating the object info being requested and a void** to
hold the returned value. xlang objects are not required to support all object information categories.
If a given object does not support a requested object information category, it returns false from
GetObjectInfo and sets the info parameter value to null.

Having a single GetObjectInfo method has two primary benefits over the IInspectable approach. Because
enums can be additively versioned over time, it is possible to add new ones over time. Since
supporting a given information category is optional, adding new ones would not break existing
objects. Furthermore, it reduces the size of the virtual function table that every xlang object
needs to support.

Over time, we expect the list of object information categories to grow. Unlike COM interfaces, we
expect the list of object information categories to be managed centrally by the xlang project.

#### Type Name

Dynamic languages such as JavaScript and Python often need to be able to discover information
about an object at runtime. In order to do this, xlang dynamic language projections must have a
mechanism to find the metadata for arbitrary xlang objects.

The TypeName information category retrieves the fully namespace qualified name of the type in
question. The property type for TypeName is an xlang_string.

In addition to the type name, a dynamic language projection would also need access to the xlang
component's metadata. The type name alone is not sufficient to project an xlang type at runtime
in a dynamic language.

> Defining an xlang API for finding and/or consuming a type's metadata by name is outside the scope
of this document. We need a design note on this.

While all information categories are optional, it is highly recommended that all objects support
TypeName in order to be usable from dynamic languages.

#### String Representation

Most mainstream languages including
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString),
[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str),
[.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring?view=netframework-4.7.2),
[Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#toString()) and
[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418956-nsobject/1418746-description)
have a mechanism to retrieve the string representation of an object.

The StringRepresentation information category retrieves the string representation of the object in
question. The property type for StringRepresentation is an xlang_string.

This information category should only be supported for types that wish to return a custom value for
a language projection's equivalent of ToString. Language projections may choose to fall back to
using the TypeName object info category if StringRepresentation is not supported by a given object.

#### Object Size

In languages C# and Java, garbage collection happens on background threads on a non-deterministic
schedule. These garbage collectors typically depend on an omniscient understanding of memory usage.
The memory used by xlang components is not typically visible to these garbage collectors, leading
to uninformed decision making regarding collection scheduling. If these systems could retrieve
the size of arbitrary xlang objects, their scheduling heuristics would be better and the system
would run more smoothly overall.

The ObjectSize information category retrieves the memory usage in bytes of the object in question.
The property type for ObjectSize is an unsigned 32-bit integer.

### Object Equality

> TODO [xlang issue #133](https://github.com/Microsoft/xlang/issues/133)

## Weak References

One issue faced in COM based systems is circular references - i.e. two objects that each hold a
reference to the other. In this case, neither reference count will ever go to zero and neither
object will ever be cleaned up. To avoid this issue, xlang objects can optionally support weak references.

A weak reference to an xlang object does not keep it alive. In other words, when the non-weak
reference count of an object goes to zero, it cleans itself up even if there are outstanding weak
references to it.

Weak references are retrieved for an arbitrary xlang object by querying for the IWeakReferenceSource
interface and calling GetWeakReference. If an object does not support weak references, it simply
fails the query.

Given an IWeakReference pointer, a strong reference to the specified object can be retrieved by
calling the IWeakReference::Resolve method. Similar to QueryInterface, the Resolve method takes
the GUID identifying the requested interface and a void** parameter to store the requested interface
pointer. If the specified object has been cleaned up, the Resolve method return 0 (S_OK) but the
void** parameter is null.

Because IWeakReferenceSource and IWeakReference are ABI interfaces that are not part of the
projected surface of any API, they inherit from IUnknown rather than IXlangObject.

``` cpp
// IWeakReference GUID identifier: 00000037-0000-0000-C000-000000000046
struct IWeakReference : IUnknown
{
    int32_t Resolve(guid const& iid, void** object_reference);
};

// IWeakReferenceSource GUID identifier: 00000038-0000-0000-C000-000000000046
struct IWeakReferenceSource : IUnknown
{
    int32_t GetWeakReference(IWeakReference** weak_reference);
};
```
