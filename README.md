# xlang

## Overview
The xlang project enables developers to take existing shared libraries,
implemented in one programming language and make that library's APIs available to client code using a different programming language. Thus the name "xlang", for cross-language.

Additionally, the xlang toolset will be available on multiple operating systems.
This means that if your shared library is portable to various operating systems,
then you can use the xlang tooling to make that shared library available to various client programming language on those various platforms.

More succinctly, you can take a library written in language A and make it available to language B applications running on platform C. The set of supported languages and platforms will expand as the project progresses.

The xlang project is in a very, very early stage of development.
The project wants and encourages community feedback and contributions. As such, the xlang team is doing *all* xlang project development in the open on GitHub. 

## What xlang is NOT

* The xlang project is not a port of the Windows Runtime, COM, DCOM or related technology.
* The xlang project will not port the Windows Runtime APIs.
